# Lab-4_algo
The aim of the algorithm is to find min count of splits of the String to make each part a degree of the number (in binary system).

Input: String, which contains from “1” and “0” characters (0<n<100);
Integer number (0<n<100) .

Output: min count of the splits (if there are no such opportunity display “-1”).

Complexity of the algorithm: O(n^2).
